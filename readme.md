### About

As of late, it appears some members of Congress are seeing stellar performance in their stock portfolios - or least the awareness of such is increasing.  While there is a lot of conjecture on the source of many Congressmembers' gains, this app simply displays the stock trading activity and portfolio performance of Congress members - something that is already publicly available information (See [House members trading](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/PublicDisclosure/FinancialDisclosure), [Senate trading](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/lobbyingdisc.htm#lobbyingdisc=lda)).
